Udemy Clone – Online Learning Platform (HTML & CSS)

I developed a responsive Udemy clone website using pure HTML and CSS. The project replicates key sections of the Udemy interface, including the homepage layout, navigation bar, category sections, featured courses, and footer. It focuses on clean UI design, semantic structure, and mobile-friendly responsiveness.

Key Features:

Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid

Modern homepage with hero banner, search bar, and course categories

Course cards styled to match Udemy’s design pattern

Organized folder structure following best HTML/CSS practices
